## About DavidDaniels.com

It all started back in the year 2000. The web was quite young, Google was just a baby and Facebook had not even been conceived yet. This was the time I decided to aquire my domain on the web. Even though this is a dot.com domain it still holds a special place for me as my personal site. We have been through a lot of growth together.

### Summary (Hero Section)

Before Facebook, Twitter and the current social media mess there was the net and since 2000 I have had an active home on "the Net" with this domain. I have since graduated from the mainstream ghetto socials [Facebook, Instagram, twitters...] to settle into better areas of the net where I continue to do my work. And it is not just about tech...

### How DavidDaniels.com works

**How to use the site**

I am a web designer by trade but since this site doubles as my personal site you will find resources that may help you in other areas of your life. Don't expect financial advice as I believe your finances follow your passion and there are other people out there who are passionate about finances. But in the areas of health, productivity, design and contact building I may be able to answer a question or two.
